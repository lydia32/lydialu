            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Gourmety is a culinary exploration platform tailored specifically for teenagers, while remaining accessible to all aspiring cooks, regardless of their culinary constraints.</p>
            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>Nutrition and meal preparation play pivotal roles in our daily lives, yet teenagers today face significant challenges in adopting healthy eating habits due to a multitude of factors. According to a survey by the American Psychological Association, teenagers report feeling overwhelmed by academic pressures, extracurricular activities, and social obligations, leaving them with limited time to dedicate to cooking nutritious meals. Additionally, studies published in the Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior highlight the lack of basic cooking skills and nutrition knowledge among teenagers, often attributed to a lack of exposure to cooking at home or in school.</p>
            <p>Moreover, many teenagers encounter barriers such as limited access to cooking resources, including kitchen equipment and space, especially those residing in dormitories or shared housing. Anecdotal evidence suggests that ingredient availability, particularly in urban areas or food deserts, further exacerbates the challenge of preparing healthy meals. Coupled with a lack of confidence in their cooking abilities and motivation to cook from scratch, teenagers often resort to unhealthy eating habits or rely on processed foods.</p>
            <h3>Possible Solution</h3>
            <p>In light of these challenges, there is a pressing need for a solution that empowers teenagers to overcome barriers to cooking and nutrition education. Introducing a comprehensive recipe search feature, equipped with advanced filtering options tailored to the specific constraints faced by teenagers, can serve as a catalyst for change. By providing accessible, nutritious recipes that accommodate limited time, resources, and cooking skills, the Gourmety app aims to revolutionize the way teenagers approach cooking, empowering them to make healthier food choices and develop essential life skills.</p>
