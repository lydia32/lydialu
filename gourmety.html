        <section id="overview">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Gourmety is a culinary exploration platform designed specifically for teenagers, while remaining accessible to anyone eager to learn cooking, regardless of their constraints.</p>
            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>Nutrition and meal preparation are essential parts of daily life, yet teenagers today face significant challenges in adopting healthy eating habits due to various factors. According to a survey by the American Psychological Association, teenagers often feel overwhelmed by academic pressures, extracurricular commitments, and social demands, leaving them little time to focus on preparing nutritious meals. Studies published in the Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior also reveal a widespread lack of basic cooking skills and nutrition knowledge among teenagers, often stemming from insufficient exposure to cooking at home or school.</p>
            <p>Beyond this, many teenagers face additional hurdles, such as limited access to kitchen equipment and spaceâ€”a common issue for those living in dormitories or shared housing. Anecdotal evidence also points to ingredient availability, especially in urban areas or food deserts, as a significant obstacle to preparing healthy meals. Combined with a lack of confidence in their cooking abilities and motivation to cook from scratch, teenagers frequently resort to unhealthy eating habits or processed foods.</p>
            <h3>Possible Solution</h3>
            <p>To address these challenges, there is a clear need for a solution that helps teenagers overcome barriers to cooking and nutrition education. Introducing a comprehensive recipe search feature with advanced filtering options tailored to the unique constraints teenagers face could be transformative. By offering accessible, nutritious recipes that align with limited time, resources, and cooking skills, the Gourmety app aims to empower teenagers to make healthier food choices, build confidence in the kitchen, and develop essential life skills.</p>
