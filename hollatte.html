            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Hollatte, nestled in a secluded alley, beckons with its allure of unique coffee blends, delectable light meals, and a serene ambiance. Beyond its delightful offerings, the allure of tranquility and limited seating further captivates customers, making it a cherished haven for coffee enthusiasts and seekers of quiet retreats alike.</p>
            <p>As part of a project for the Google UX Design certificate, the task involves crafting an intuitive and engaging app for Hollatte Coffee. This app aims to seamlessly bridge the gap between customers and their coffee cravings by offering a convenient platform for ordering favorite beverages and meals, reserving tables in advance, and staying updated about the cafe's ambiance and available seating.</p>
            <h4>Project Duration</h4>

Without clear information about meal pickup times at cafes like Hollatte, these individuals risk delays and interruptions to their daily routines, impacting productivity and causing frustration.</p>
            <p>In a bustling cityscape, customers seek solace in havens like Hollatte, craving not just exceptional coffee but also a serene environment to unwind. However, without prior knowledge of the cafe's ambiance and seat availability, their quest for tranquility can turn into a gamble, potentially leading to disappointment and a missed opportunity for relaxation.</p>

            <h2>Starting the Design</h2>
            <p>Embarking on the design journey for Hollatte's app, I delve into crafting an intuitive and seamless user experience. Guided by extensive research insights and user personas, I am poised to translate these findings into actionable design decisions. Let's dive into the process of shaping an app that not only meets but exceeds the expectations of our diverse user base.</p>    
            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <h4>Paper Wireframes</h4>
            <div class="flex-parent">
                <p>For the home screen, I've created a captivating picture wall showcasing Hollatte's inviting atmosphere. Alongside, the "Today’s Special" section grabs attention with enticing offers, encouraging users to explore further.</p>
                <div class="image-container large">
                    <img src="img/hollatte/paper wireframe.png" alt="Paper Wireframe of Home Screen">

                <li>The prominence of the Personal Account icon was deemed excessive, potentially distracting users from other critical features.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Round 2 Findings: </h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Participants found the reservation function to be incomplete, indicating a need for further development and refinement.</li>

                <li>
                    <div class="flex-parent">
                        <p>Provide traffic information and contact information for those in need.</p>
                        <div class="image-container small">

                <li>The navigation menu offers links to anywhere, letting users to know where they are.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Mockups</h3>
            <p>After usability test, I added a clear message of order completion after confirming the items.</p>
            <div class="image-container small">
                <img src="img/hollatte/mockup1.png" alt="Order Completion">
            </div>
            <p>Since the main user flow is ordering, not personal account relevances, I redesign the tab bar with menu in the middle.</p>
            <div class="image-container small">
                <img src="img/hollatte/mockup2.png" alt="Icon Priority">

            </div>
            <h3>High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
            <p>Once the design was refined, I created high-fidelity mockups to visualize the app's look and feel. These mockups provided a detailed representation of the app's interface, including typography, colors, and imagery.</p>
