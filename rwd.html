            <p>Welcome to my final project for the Web Design for Everybody course! Throughout this journey, I've delved into HTML, CSS, and responsive web design principles, honing my skills to create engaging front-end experiences.</p>
            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <p>For our final assignment, we were tasked with crafting a three-page website from scratch, utilizing a template, or leveraging a framework. The website had to incorporate various layouts for different screen sizes and showcase at least four images on one of the pages. Additionally, we were encouraged to apply four "extra" front-end skills to our designs.</p>
            <h4>My Approach</h4>
            <p>I chose to build my website from the ground up, crafting three distinct pages: an about me page, a project page, and a resume page. Each page was meticulously designed to balance aesthetics with functionality, offering users a seamless browsing experience.</p>
            <h4>Innovative Features</h4>
            <p>To elevate my design, I implemented several advanced front-end techniques:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Sticky navigation bar and footer</strong>: Enhancing navigation and accessibility across all pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Pseudo element</strong>: Leveraging CSS wizardry to add depth and visual interest to elements.</li>
                <li><strong>Prefix application</strong>: Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and smooth rendering.</li>
                <li><strong>3D image flip</strong>: Incorporating an eye-catching animation to captivate users.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Visual Representation</h4>
            <p>At the top of the page, you'll find wireframes of my website showcasing its adaptability across large and mobile screens. Below, you can explore a live demo of the site to experience its functionality firsthand.</p>

            <div class="videowrap">
                <video controls>
                    <source src="img/rwd/video.mp4">
                </video>
            </div>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>This project has been a rewarding culmination of my learning journey in web design. It's not just about building a website; it's about crafting immersive digital experiences that resonate with users. I'm excited to share my work and eager to continue exploring new frontiers in web development.</p>
            <p>Thank you for joining me on this adventure!</p>
